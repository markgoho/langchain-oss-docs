### Features

We provide usage of two types of tools for use with `ChatWriter`: `function` and `graph`.

#### Function

Functions are the most common type of tool, which allows the LLM to call external APIs, fetch data from databases, and generally perform any external action you want to do. Visit our [tool calling docs](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/tool-calling#tool-calling) for additional information.

#### Graph

The `Graph` tool is Writer's graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) called Knowledge Graph. This tool enables developers to simply pass the graph ID to the model and it will return the answer to the question in the prompt. To learn more, see our [Knowledge Graph API docs](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/knowledge-graph).

## Setup

Sign up for [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup?utm_campaign=devrel) to generate an API key (you can follow this [Quickstart](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/quickstart)). Then, set the WRITER_API_KEY environment variable:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("WRITER_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["WRITER_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Writer API key: ")
```

## Usage

You can bind graph or function tools to `ChatWriter`.

### Graph Tools

To bind graph tools, first create and initialize a `GraphTool` instance with the `graph_ids` you want to use as sources:

```python
from langchain_writer.chat_models import ChatWriter
from langchain_writer.tools import GraphTool

chat = ChatWriter()

graph_id = getpass.getpass("Enter Writer Knowledge Graph ID: ")
graph_tool = GraphTool(graph_ids=[graph_id])
```

## Instantiation

```python
from typing import Optional

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


@tool
def get_supercopa_trophies_count(club_name: str) -> Optional[int]:
    """Returns information about supercopa trophies count.

    Args:
        club_name: Club you want to investigate info of supercopa trophies about

    Returns:
        Number of supercopa trophies or None if there is no info about requested club
    """

    if club_name == "Barcelona":
        return 15
    elif club_name == "Real Madrid":
        return 13
    elif club_name == "Atletico Madrid":
        return 2
    else:
        return None


class GetWeather(BaseModel):
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""

    location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


get_product_info = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_product_info",
        "description": "Get information about a product by its id",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "product_id": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "The unique identifier of the product to retrieve information for",
                }
            },
            "required": ["product_id"],
        },
    },
}
```

### Binding tools

Then, you can simply bind all tools to the `ChatWriter` instance:

```python
chat.bind_tools(
    [graph_tool, get_supercopa_trophies_count, GetWeather, get_product_info]
)
```

All tools are stored in the `tools` attribute of the `ChatWriter` instance:

```python
chat.tools
```

The tool choice mode is stored at the `tool_choice` attribute, which is `auto` by default:

```python
chat.tool_choice
```

## Invocation

The model will automatically choose the tool during invocation with all modes (streaming/non-streaming, sync/async).

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

messages = [
    HumanMessage(
        "Use knowledge graph tool to compose this answer. Tell me what th first line of documents stored in your KG. Also I want to know: how many SuperCopa trophies have Barcelona won?"
    )
]

response = chat.invoke(messages)
messages.append(response)
```

In the case of function tools, you will receive an assistant message with the tool call request.

```python
print(response.tool_calls)
```

Then you can manually handle tool call request, send to model and receive final response:

```python
for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
    selected_tool = {
        "get_supercopa_trophies_count": get_supercopa_trophies_count,
    }[tool_call["name"].lower()]
    tool_msg = selected_tool.invoke(tool_call)
    messages.append(tool_msg)

response = chat.invoke(messages)
print(response.content)
```

With a `GraphTool`, the model will call it remotely and return usage info in the `additional_kwargs` under the `graph_data` key:

```python
print(response.additional_kwargs["graph_data"])
```

The `content` attribute contains the final response:

```python
print(response.content)
```

## Chaining

Due to specificity of Writer Graph tool (you don't need to call it manually, Writer server will call it by himself and return RAG based generation) it's impossible to invoke it separately, so GraphTool can't be used as part of chain

## API reference

For detailed documentation of all `GraphTool` features and configurations, head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/writer/tools/langchain_writer.tools.GraphTool.html#langchain_writer.tools.GraphTool).
