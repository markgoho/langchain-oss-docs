title: Zep Cloud Memory
---

> Recall, understand, and extract data from chat histories. Power personalized AI experiences.

>[Zep](https://www.getzep.com) is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps.
> With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant,
> while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost.

> See [Zep Cloud Installation Guide](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) and more [Zep Cloud LangChain Examples](https://github.com/getzep/zep-python/tree/main/examples)

## Example

This notebook demonstrates how to use [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) as memory for your chatbot.

We'll demonstrate:

1. Adding conversation history to Zep.
2. Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.
3. Viewing the enriched messages.
4. Vector search over the conversation history.

### Add some history data

```python

### Run the agent

Doing so will automatically add the input and response to the Zep memory.

```python

)
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

### Inspect the Zep memory

Note the summary, and that the history has been enriched with token counts, UUIDs, and timestamps.

Summaries are biased towards the most recent messages.

```python
def print_messages(messages):
    for m in messages:
        print(m.type, ":\n", m.dict())


print(memory.chat_memory.zep_summary)
print("\n")
print("Conversation Facts: ")
facts = memory.chat_memory.zep_facts
for fact in facts:
    print(fact + "\n")
print_messages(memory.chat_memory.messages)
```

```output

### Vector search over the Zep memory

Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory via the `ZepRetriever`.

You can use the `ZepRetriever` with chains that support passing in a LangChain `Retriever` object.

```python
retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(
    session_id=session_id,
    api_key=zep_api_key,
)

search_results = memory.chat_memory.search("who are some famous women sci-fi authors?")
for r in search_results:
    if r.score > 0.8:  # Only print results with similarity of 0.8 or higher
        print(r.message, r.score)
```

```output
content='Which other women sci-fi writers might I want to read?' created_at='2024-05-10T14:34:16.714292Z' metadata=None role='human' role_type=None token_count=12 updated_at='0001-01-01T00:00:00Z' uuid_='64ca1fae-8db1-4b4f-8a45-9b0e57e88af5' 0.8960460126399994
```
