While traditional software applications are built by writing code, AI applications involve writing **prompts to instruct the LLM on what to do**. LangSmith gives you tools to **iterate, version, and collaborate on prompts** so you can continuously improve your application.

This guide will walk through how to create, test, and iterate on prompts using the SDK and in the UI. In this guide we will use OpenAI, but you can also use other LLM providers.

## SDK

    ### 1. Setup

    First, install the required packages:

        <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Python
    pip install -qU langsmith openai langchain_core
    ```

    ```bash TypeScript
    yarn add langsmith @langchain/core langchain openai
    ```

        </CodeGroup>

    Next, make sure you have signed up for a [LangSmith](https://langsmith.com) account, then [create](/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key) and set your API key. You will also want to sign up for an OpenAI API key to run the code in this tutorial.

    ```
    LANGSMITH_API_KEY = '<your_api_key>'
    OPENAI_API_KEY = '<your_api_key>'
    ```

    ### 2. Create a prompt

    To create a prompt in LangSmith, define the list of messages you want in your prompt and then wrap them using the `ChatPromptTemplate` function ([Python](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.chat.ChatPromptTemplate.html)) or [TypeScript](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core/prompts.ChatPromptTemplate.html) function. Then all you have to do is call [`push_prompt`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/client/langsmith.client.Client#langsmith.client.Client.push_prompt) (Python) or [`pushPrompt`](https://langsmith-docs-7jgx2bq8f-langchain.vercel.app/reference/js/classes/client.Client#pushprompt) (TypeScript) to send your prompt to LangSmith!

        <CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from langsmith import Client
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

    # Connect to the LangSmith client
    client = Client()

    # Define the prompt
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate([
        ("system", "You are a helpful chatbot."),
        ("user", "{question}"),
    ])

    # Push the prompt
    client.push_prompt("my-prompt", object=prompt)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Client } from "langsmith";
    import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

    // Connect to the LangSmith client
    const client = new Client();

    // Define the prompt
    const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
        ["system", "You are a helpful chatbot."],
        ["user", "{question}"]
    ]);

    // Push the prompt
    await client.pushPrompt("my-prompt", {
        object: prompt
    });
    ```

        </CodeGroup>

    ### 3. Test a prompt

    To test a prompt, you need to pull the prompt, invoke it with the input values you want to test and then call the model with those input values. your LLM or application expects.

        <CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from langsmith import Client
    from openai import OpenAI
    from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_openai_messages

    # Connect to LangSmith and OpenAI
    client = Client()
    oai_client = OpenAI()

    # Pull the prompt to use
    # You can also specify a specific commit by passing the commit hash "my-prompt:<commit-hash>"
    prompt = client.pull_prompt("my-prompt")

    # Since our prompt only has one variable we could also pass in the value directly
    # The code below is equivalent to formatted_prompt = prompt.invoke("What is the color of the sky?")
    formatted_prompt = prompt.invoke({"question": "What is the color of the sky?"})

    # Test the prompt
    response = oai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=convert_to_openai_messages(formatted_prompt.messages),
    )
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { OpenAI } from "openai";
    import { pull } from "langchain/hub"
    import { convertPromptToOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

    // Connect to LangSmith and OpenAI
    const oaiClient = new OpenAI();

    // Pull the prompt to use
    // You can also specify a specific commit by passing the commit hash "my-prompt:<commit-hash>"
    const prompt = await pull("my-prompt");

    // Format the prompt with the question
    const formattedPrompt = await prompt.invoke({ question: "What is the color of the sky?" });

    // Test the prompt
    const response = await oaiClient.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: convertPromptToOpenAI(formattedPrompt).messages,
    });
    ```

        </CodeGroup>

    ### 4. Iterate on a prompt

    LangSmith makes it easy to iterate on prompts with your entire team. Members of your workspace can select a prompt to iterate on, and once they are happy with their changes, they can simply save it as a new commit.

    To improve your prompts:

    * We recommend referencing the documentation provided by your model provider for best practices in prompt creation, such as [Best practices for prompt engineering with the OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api) and [Gemini's Introduction to prompt design](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro).

    * To help with iterating on your prompts in LangSmith, we've created Prompt Canvas â€” an interactive tool to build and optimize your prompts. Learn about how to use [Prompt Canvas](/langsmith/observability-concepts#prompt-canvas).

    To add a new commit to a prompt, you can use the same [`push_prompt`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/client/langsmith.client.Client#langsmith.client.Client.push_prompt) (Python) or [`pushPrompt`](https://langsmith-docs-7jgx2bq8f-langchain.vercel.app/reference/js/classes/client.Client#pushprompt) (TypeScript) methods as when you first created the prompt.

        <CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from langsmith import Client
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

    # Connect to the LangSmith client
    client = Client()

    # Define the prompt to update
    new_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate([
        ("system", "You are a helpful chatbot. Respond in Spanish."),
        ("user", "{question}"),
    ])

    # Push the updated prompt making sure to use the correct prompt name
    # Tags can help you remember specific versions in your commit history
    client.push_prompt("my-prompt", object=new_prompt, tags=["Spanish"])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { Client } from "langsmith";
    import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

    // Connect to the LangSmith client
    const client = new Client();

    // Define the prompt
    const newPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
        ["system", "You are a helpful chatbot. Speak in Spanish."],
        ["user", "{question}"]
    ]);

    // Push the updated prompt making sure to use the correct prompt name
    // Tags can help you remember specific versions in your commit history
    await client.pushPrompt("my-prompt", {
        object: newPrompt,
        tags: ["Spanish"]
    });
    ```

        </CodeGroup>

## UI

    This quick start will walk through how to create, test, and iterate on prompts in LangSmith.

        <Info>
        This tutorial uses the UI for prompt engineering, if you are interested in using the SDK instead, read [this guide](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-quickstart).
        </Info>

    ### 1. Setup

    The only setup needed for this guide is to make sure you have signed up for a [LangSmith](https://langsmith.com) account.

    ### 2. Create a prompt

    To create a prompt in LangSmith, navigate to the **Prompts** section of the left-hand sidebar and click on the "+ New Prompt" button. You can then modify the prompt by editing/adding messages and input variables.
